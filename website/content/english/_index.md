# Primantik: Priming experiment

## Aim

The aim of the experiment is to determine whether there is a difference in the processing of words that are in an associative relationship compared to words that are in a semantic relationship. This is a replication of the experiment by Roelke et al: [A novel co-occurrence-based approach to predict pure associative and semantic priming](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-018-1453-6).

## Team

We are four students of linguistics at the University of Vienna who want to find out more about the structure of human language and its processing in the brain.
